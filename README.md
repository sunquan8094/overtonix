## Building
Open the Projucer file and generate a project for your IDE of choice. Compilation should be done within your IDE. See Projucer documentation for more details.

## Testing
This plugin has been tested only with Logic Pro X and FL Studio 20 on macOS El Capitan thus far. Email me if you would like to test, preferably with other DAWs and operating systems.
